# ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data science project developed during the internship final task at ID/X Partners. The goal is to predict loan default risks using historical Lending Club data from 2007 to 2014.

The project uses a business-focused approach based on the CRISP-DM methodology, covering data understanding, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and business recommendations.

The dataset consists of 466,284 loan records and 75 features related to borrower profiles, loan amounts, payment statuses, and credit history. The main classification target is the `loan_status` feature, which is simplified into two categories:
- `GOOD`: Fully Paid
- `BAD`: Charged Off, Late, Default, and other failed statuses

Because the dataset is heavily imbalanced (GOOD >> BAD), the modeling and evaluation strategies were carefully designed to ensure meaningful risk detection.

Key steps in this project include:

- **Data Understanding**  
  Identified imbalance in label distribution and a need to consolidate loan statuses into binary labels (GOOD vs BAD).

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Removed 12 non-informative columns (e.g., ID, URL, desc), defined target label, and inspected missing values.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Conducted label distribution visualization and correlation heatmap to observe feature relationships and redundancy.

- **Data Preparation**  
  Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features, normalized numeric features using StandardScaler, label-encoded the target, and performed stratified 80:20 train-test split.

- **Modeling**  
  Implemented two classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Logistic Regression serves as a baseline model, while Random Forest provides stronger recall and feature flexibility.

- **Evaluation**  
  Models were evaluated using Accuracy, ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Results show Random Forest outperforms the baseline:
  Visual outputs include countplots, feature importance charts, and predicted probability distributions.

### Business Impact & Recommendations

The model supports data-driven credit scoring by identifying high-risk applicants before approval. This can reduce financial losses and improve loan portfolio quality. Future enhancements include:

- Integrating third-party credit scoring data
- Balancing the dataset with techniques like SMOTE
- Performing periodic model retraining (e.g., quarterly)
- Deploying the model through APIs or dashboard scoring systems
